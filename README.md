### Project Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing cardiovascular health data using machine learning techniques to classify and predict cardiovascular conditions. By leveraging a range of data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation steps, this project aims to identify significant patterns and factors that contribute to cardiovascular risk.

### Workflow Summary
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned and transformed, including encoding categorical variables and standardizing numeric features, to prepare for modeling.
2. **Model Selection and Training**: Several machine learning models—such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Classifier (SVC)—are trained to classify cardiovascular risk.
3. **Ensemble Modeling**: An ensemble approach using Voting Classifier combines multiple models to improve prediction accuracy.
4. **Evaluation**: Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics to assess predictive capability.

This pipeline provides a systematic approach to understand cardiovascular risks and contributes to creating more effective health interventions.
